Experience

Vsnap - Junior Front-End UX/UI Developer
            
  My first project was to create Vsnap's 'Board-Game Night App' 
  where visitors can register for events:
    Wireframed in Balsamiq
    User tested for UX/UI
    Designed HI-Res mockups in Photoshop
    Developed the app using Angular.js

  Currently I am working on the front-end of 
  Vsnap's app creating pages and user-flows:
    
    Angular.js / NPM / Gulp / Karma / Lint / Bower
    Agile Development - Jira / Slack
    Test-Driven Development

  I was also very lucky to have built a life-size Doctor 
  Who TARDIS to be a quiet space for recording vsnaps and to take phone calls.

  Steve was originally recommended by my son Guillaume. Steve had just started his company and I thought I would give him a chance. It turns out to be one of my best decisions of the last 2 years. Steve is a very creative, resourceful and a go-getter type individual. As a young entrepreneur he does not count his time nor his energy. We created a website together from scratch, developed the company brochure and various marketing collateral. Currently Steve is helping PICA to design a booth for a major Security trade-show in New York City and we have more projects in the funnel.

    I am happy to provide Stephen with my strongest recommendation for his website development work for us. Not only does he possess a tremendous amount of technical knowledge, but his personable easy-going approach made the creative side so much easier for us. If you're looking for a website developer look no further. Stephen is the guy for the job.
