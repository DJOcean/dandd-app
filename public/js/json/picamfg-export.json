Amy graduated from Shanghai Normal University with a Bachelor of English Language. She has spent most of her career working in purchasing.   When asked why component sourcing was strategic for PICA, Simon Lim said: â€œIt is tempting to assume that flexible circuits (FPCs) are no different from rigid boards (PCBs) and that any contract manufacturers can do component assembly on flexes produced by any manufacturer. The reality is that flex circuits have very unique properties which create a whole different range of manufacturing challenges and consequently it is more efficient to have the same bare flex manufacturing also doing component assembly. That way we avoid finger-pointing and blame-game when faced  with a problem.  PICA Manufacturing Solutions combines bare flex and assembly processes under the same roof. Component sourcing and procurement has become a top priority at a time when cost-conscious customers are demanding faster quotations, higher reliability and lower prices.",
